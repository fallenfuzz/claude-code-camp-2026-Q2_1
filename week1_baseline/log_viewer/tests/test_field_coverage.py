"""Every field the log carries is SURFACED somewhere, not merely present.

The rule: the data should be readable from different angles. What has to be prevented
is holding the data and still being unable to see what is in it.

The raw lens prints whole records, so technically nothing is invisible. That is not the
same as surfaced. A reader chasing why a turn died on `max_tokens` should not have to
find the ceiling by reading JSON, and a field that only ever appears as raw JSON has all
the discoverability of not being logged at all.

So this converts the rule from an intention into something that fails a run: for every
field the fixtures carry, some renderer must NAME it. A field the writer gains with no
home in the viewer fails here on the next run rather than going unseen for a month.

RAW_ONLY is the escape hatch and it works like the import allowlist: a field goes in it
with a reason, which makes leaving something raw a decision somebody makes visibly rather
than an omission nobody notices.
