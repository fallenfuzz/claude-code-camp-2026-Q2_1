# Week 3 Technical Documentation

## Technical Goal

Make the agent capable of a hard game goal on a small model: find and kill
the Massive Minotaur, a strong monster somewhere in the unexplored game
world, efficiently in steps and cost. Week 2 made the agent observable.
Week 3 uses that instrument to find out why missions fail and to build the
knowledge and machinery that make them succeed.

The design premise, argued before any evidence: a hard goal handed to a
fresh model is a failure before the mission starts. The game has survival
rules a language model cannot know from the goal text alone. Characters
tire after too many moves and must rest. Dark areas blind the player
without a light source. Some monsters attack on sight. Health, hunger,
thirst, equipment, and experience level all gate what is survivable. The
plan is therefore knowledge first: facts the agent earns by playing, rules
we author for it, and deterministic machinery (route planning, survival
reflexes, a preparation planner) that spends the model's attention only on
judgment. The full design is in
[the knowledge plan](../plans/week3_capable/knowledge.md).

## Technical Uncertainty

- I do not know whether a small model can complete this mission at all,
  even with good knowledge. The binding constraint could be model judgment
  rather than missing facts.
- I do not know which failure actually dominates: not knowing where the
  target is, dying to game mechanics, or burning the budget on wandering.
  Guessing wrong would spend the week building the wrong capability first.
- Moving decisions out of the model and into deterministic code risks
  hiding failures instead of fixing them, if the machinery is wrong.

## Technical Hypotheses

- Repeated identical attempts will fail in a stable, measurable pattern,
  and that pattern will rank the capabilities to build better than any
  design argument.
- Most of the budget will be lost to navigation and wandering, not to
  wrong decisions at genuine choice points.
- Survival mechanics (exhaustion, darkness, aggressive monsters, hunger)
  will fire inside even short runs, without the agent understanding them.
- Knowledge retained across runs will make repeat missions measurably
  cheaper, which is the claim the week should end by proving or refuting.

## Technical Observations

### 1. Thirteen cold missions, zero sightings: the autopsy ranked the work

Before building anything we ran the mission as-is, repeatedly, to let
recorded failures choose the build order. Method: the benchmark launches
the unmodified agent with the goal "Find the minotaur and kill it.", no
location hint, on the small model already in use. Every attempt is cold:
the player is reset to the temple at level 1 with baseline memory, and a
verified reset receipt is retained before the first model call. Each
attempt is capped at eight minutes of wall clock and about twenty cents of
model spend. Success is judged only from game evidence (the monster's
death message), never from the agent's own claim.

Thirteen attempts completed, costing $2.84 in total.

- No attempt ever saw the minotaur. Roughly 1,150 model calls produced
  zero sightings of the target. Every attempt spent its entire budget
  wandering, which confirms that locating the goal is its own problem, not
  a detail of movement.
- Darkness was the dominant hazard by an order of magnitude: 79 retained
  "it is pitch black" observations. The agent walks into dark areas it
  cannot perceive, keeps acting blindly inside them, and does not leave.
  In the design's failure inventory darkness was one hazard among many.
  The evidence promoted it to second place.
- Aggressive monsters attacked 12 times and killed the agent 3 times.
  The agent fled 4 times, so escape happens, but not by policy.
- Movement exhaustion rejected commands 6 times, and hunger and thirst
  appeared even within eight-minute runs.
- Attempt cost was stable near the ceiling (about $0.22, roughly 90 model
  calls) with two shorter self-ended runs, so the failure pattern is
  consistent rather than noisy.

One methodological result stands on its own: the observability stack paid
for itself here. A live map defect surfaced during the first manual
mission (the layout crashed on a world shape only deep exploration
produces), was reproduced from the retained session payload, fixed, and
pinned by a regression test, all while the mission kept running.

The consequence for the plan: build the locate machinery first, darkness
handling second, then the rest and flee reflexes. Combat interrupts
matter, but nothing else matters while every dollar goes to blind
wandering.

### 2. The capabilities landed as five flags, and the first live sweep paid off

The build followed the autopsy's ranking as five independently switchable
capabilities: navigation (routing and systematic exploration over the
agent's own map), knowledge (a re-rendered state summary each model call,
required per-response state fields, and the agent's assertions stored as
distinct beliefs), survival (numeric reflexes: the game's own auto-flee
threshold kept set, rest before movement runs out), economy (banking gold
above a ceiling at a place the agent recorded as a bank), and campaign
(a deterministic mission phase chosen from typed readiness). With every
flag off, the advertised tool surface and its digest are unchanged from
the measured baseline, so any subset can run as an experiment arm.

The one live verification that fit before the account's API credits ran
out was worth the night on its own: a single exploration call walked 47
steps and discovered 30 rooms with typed stop reasons and vitals
tracking, where the baseline had spent roughly 90 model calls per attempt
discovering less. The same short verification loop caught two defects no
unit test had found, because both lived in real data:

- Stored exit lists use the game's abbreviations ("n") while learned
  exit links use full words ("north"), so the set arithmetic that finds
  unexplored exits never matched on real stores. The synthetic test
  fixtures had used full words on both sides and hidden it.
- Right after a baseline reset, the store is wiped but the in-process
  position state is not, so the two disagree about the current room at
  exactly the moment a cold mission starts. The exploration routine now
  falls back to the live room observation; whether a reset should also
  reset in-process state is an open question.

Credits ran out mid-verification, so the comparison batch, the
per-capability measurements, and the learning curve remain queued rather
than claimed. Nothing in this observation asserts mission improvement:
that number does not exist until the batch runs.

### 3. The before and after: fewer decisions, no deaths, a map that compounds

With credits restored, the same mission ran as three measured cohorts
against the retained thirteen-attempt baseline, all under the same reset
and the same evidence-based judge.

- Cold, all capabilities on, eleven attempts: 28.5 model calls per
  attempt against the baseline's 86.3, a 67% reduction, and the spread
  collapsed from ±21.4 calls to ±0.5. Deterministic routines made
  attempts nearly identical where the baseline was noise. Zero deaths
  against three, and none of the baseline's hazard signatures (79
  darkness lines, 12 attacks, 6 exhaustion rejections) appeared at all.
  Two caveats stated: the per-attempt cost ceilings differed slightly,
  and bounded sweeps may avoid hazards partly by staying nearer safe
  ground.
- The tool mix explains the reduction: a capable attempt issues sweep
  routines and reads its state summary, with zero single-step move
  calls. The model spends its calls deciding, not walking.
- Warm, knowledge retained across five runs: call counts stay flat at
  the spend ceiling, but coverage compounds. The persistent map grew to
  235 distinct rooms where a cold attempt maps about 35, and every run
  pushed into new ground.
- The minotaur was never sighted in any cohort. The world is larger
  than the explored radius under these budgets, so the mission itself
  remains open. The honest claim is efficiency, survival, and compound
  coverage, not victory.

### 4. Reading the transcripts overturned the night's story

The batch numbers were reported before any transcript was read. Opening
one attempt's full log, message by message, changed the account.

- The mission-phase line the model received on every call was broken: a
  wiring fault fed it the wrong JSON layer, so every readiness field read
  "None" and the line always said "sweep them". The phase machinery's
  entire runtime effect was a constant instruction to explore.
- The required end-of-response state line was ignored on 27 of 27
  iterations even though the contract was verifiably in the prompt. The
  cause is structural: responses that call tools carry little or no
  text, so demanding a text line on every response fights the tool
  mechanism itself. The idea needs a different carrier, not a retry.
- A sweep died after four steps because the character was resting and
  the game refused to move it ("You feel too relaxed to do that"). The
  routine never checks posture before walking. Two earlier explanations
  for this stop were wrong until the journal was read.
- The model's own thoughts are 27 near-identical repetitions of
  "continue sweeping to find the minotaur". Nothing it ever saw
  mentioned its level, equipment, skills, or gold, so no other thought
  was possible.

The deeper findings are about the knowledge design itself. The store
holds only the structural skeleton of what the parser sees: room names,
exits, connections, creature and object names, own vitals. Everything
qualitative stays in the raw logs and never becomes knowledge: what
shops sell, what signs say, darkness, appraisals of monsters, doors and
keys. And the model has no way to read even the stored part: its only
window is a four-line count summary. Exploration reports pure geometry,
so the model cannot steer toward promising areas or notice a shop, a
corpse, or the target itself passing by. A swept-past minotaur would
have been recorded silently and never announced. The week 0 play skill,
with a plain text memory read before every action and a page of common
sense rules, understood the game better than this machinery does.

The call-count collapse from observation 3 stands as measured, but its
meaning shrinks: it measures cheap walking, not competent play. The
capability that matters, playing the game, was not built: no readiness
against a target, no preparation, no economy loop reached, no strategy.

### 5. The map that compounded was 235 copies of a small neighbourhood

Observation 3 reported that warm runs accumulated 235 rooms while a cold
run mapped about 35, and called it knowledge compounding. Checking that
number against the store before building anything on top of it showed
what it actually counts.

Every room the agent enters is recorded under an identity minted from
the session it was seen in. Enter the Armory in sixteen different runs
and the store holds sixteen unrelated rooms that happen to share a
title. Counting the main store: 478 room identities, 114 distinct
titles, 588 links between rooms, and not one link that crosses a
session boundary. Main Street exists thirty-four times.

So the map never joins. Five warm runs do not build one larger map, they
build five disconnected partial copies of the same small area, and the
frontier arithmetic that decides where to explore next counts the
unexplored exits of copies. Coverage, re-treading, and travelling to a
room by name are all undefined until a room means one thing.

The fix looked easy and was not. Matching rooms by title alone would
merge half the map, including a forest maze whose seven rooms share a
title, an exit list, and a description, and differ only in where their
exits lead. Merging them would invent doors that do not exist. A first
rule that refused to merge anything seen twice in one session failed
against the same store for the opposite reason: the position tracker
re-mints a room whenever it loses track of where it is, so Temple Square
and Market Square already appear several times inside a single run, and
refusing those merges splits precisely the hub rooms every route passes
through.

What survived is a rule that proposes matches by title, exits, and
description, then lets the graph decide: two candidates join only when
no exit contradicts, and preferably when a shared exit agrees. Because
no link crosses a session yet, agreement between two rooms can only be
defined through the matching being computed, so the resolver has to
iterate until it stops changing. Two readings of an earlier draft that
missed this produced 348 rooms and 288 rooms from identical data, which
is why the plan now carries predicates and a measurement script instead
of a headline number.

The wider lesson is the same one as observation 4, one level deeper. The
earlier number was not wrong because the measurement was careless. It
was wrong because nobody asked what the thing being counted was.

### 6. Two lines of wiring made every measurement noise

Before building anything on the plan, the defects the transcripts had
already shown got fixed, because a measurement taken through them means
nothing.

The first was invisible in the code and obvious in the output. A tool
result is shaped for the model before it reaches it, and in the compact
shapes that wrapper is itself JSON. The internal fetchers that build the
agent's standing context read that shaped value instead of the gateway's
own text, so the mission line arrived as machine noise and rendered
every field as "None". Two features that were supposed to tell the agent
where it stood told it nothing, for every call of every run. The fix
reads the transformation evidence that already carried the original
envelope, so it works whatever shape the model's view takes.

The second was a sweep walking a character that was sitting down. The
game refuses a move from rest, the refusal reads to the executor exactly
like a blocked exit, and three refusals exhaust the routine's setback
budget, so the sweep ended after four steps having gone nowhere. Nothing
in the routine had ever checked posture. The parser had been reporting
it the whole time and nobody was listening, which is the same shape as
the hunger signal being parsed and dropped.

Neither is interesting as engineering. Both are worth recording because
they were present during every measured run this week, including the
ones whose numbers were reported as progress.

### 7. Four reviews to get one rule right

Room identity looked like a small piece of bookkeeping and took four
adversarial reviews, each of which found something I had not.

The first rule I wrote joined 55 percent of the recorded places and I
was pleased with it. The review took the game's own room numbers as an
answer key and showed that it merged five genuinely different rooms in a
maze, which is the one failure the design says must never happen: a
wrong merge invents a door that does not exist, and a route planner will
happily walk an agent through it.

Tightening it dropped joining to 7 percent, which was safe and useless.
Finding out why exposed my real mistake. My test for "these two rooms
are different" treated two exits that had not yet been proven to lead to
the same place as proof that they led to different places. Since every
place starts out alone, a single walked exit could disqualify a room
forever. That one inversion was why the Armory, seen in sixteen
different runs, refused to become one room.

The next review found the same class of error one level up: the check
looked at one side of a merge instead of both, so two rooms that
directly disagreed could still be glued together by a third,
partly-observed room that happened to agree with each of them. The one
after that found it again one hop further out: two lookalike rooms whose
own neighbours are proven different are themselves proven different, and
I was merging them and labelling the merge confirmed. Difference is not
a comparison, it is a closure.

The final measurement, against the game's room numbers: every merge the
rule makes is correct, and it joins 43 percent of the pairs that are
truly the same room. The reviewer also found why the rest are missed,
and it is not the rule. A room's stored description sometimes contains
what was happening in the room rather than the room itself, a fled
combat line, loot on the floor, one extra drunk, so the same room reads
as two. That single defect accounts for most of the lost joins, and it
belongs to the observation pipeline, not here.

What I take from it is narrower than "reviews are good". Every one of
these bugs was invisible to the tests I wrote, because I wrote tests for
the cases I had thought of, and each defect lived in a case I had not.
The reviews that found them all did the same thing: constructed a world
where my rule had to choose, and checked the choice against something
outside my judgment.

### 8. A map that joined only after the run had ended

With the identity rule approved, wiring it looked like bookkeeping: write
the conclusions into the store, read them when building the map. The
review found that the wiring worked perfectly and delivered nothing.

Places are named per run. Recomputing identity when a run starts joins
everything earlier runs saw, but every room this run enters is named
fresh and belongs to no joined room until the run ends. So the agent
always stands in a place the joined map does not contain. Asking to walk
to a room known from yesterday returned unreachable, every time, in
exactly the situation the whole feature exists for. The recorded map was
correct and the agent could never use it.

The fix was to compute identity where the map is built rather than read
it from what was written down, so the room being stood in is joined as
soon as it is seen, and to keep the written record as the thing a person
can inspect. That inverted which part is authoritative: the stored
identity is a report, and the live computation is what the agent walks.

Two store defects fell out of the same work. Withdrawing a layer of
facts told no one: the change feed the Observatory follows never learned
the facts had gone, so a reader would show a binding that no longer
existed indefinitely. And re-observing a value that had been withdrawn
attached the observation to the withdrawn claim instead of making it
current again, so after a knowledge reset the store could report an
observation while the fact stayed absent. That is the most likely
explanation for the empty map after resets we had been attributing to
the projector.

None of the three was visible from the tests. All three were found by
someone asking what the code does when the situation is not the one it
was written for.

### 9. The room description was recording the moment, not the place

Room identity was missing joins it should have made, and the reason was
not the rule. A room's stored description was carrying whatever happened
to be in the room when it was looked at.

The parser treated every line it could not classify as part of the
description. A creature whose line it did not recognise, an item lying
on the floor, a combat message arriving mid-look, all became part of
what the room supposedly is. So the Dark Alley At The Levee had two
descriptions across two visits, differing by a fled combat line, and the
resolver correctly concluded they were different rooms. Measured cost:
27 pairs of places falsely proven different, and 188 pairs the game's own
room numbers say are the same held apart.

The fix is structural rather than another pattern to match. This game
prints a room as title, description, exits, then whatever is present. The
description therefore ends at the exits line, and everything after it
belongs to the moment. One flag in the parser.

It does not repair what is already recorded, since those descriptions
were stored with the pollution in them, so the measured recall on the
existing store is unchanged. It changes what every future run records,
and the recorded past can only be repaired by replaying the journals,
which is its own step.

### 10. Facts that were written where nobody was reading

Three facts landed this round and a review found each of them addressed
to the wrong place, in a different way.

Cleaning the room description moved combat prose out of what a room is,
which was the point, but it moved it into the list of creatures present.
So the agent would have remembered "You flee head over heels" as
something living in the alley, and said so when asked what it had seen.
The line had stopped corrupting the map and started corrupting the
memory instead. Anything after the exits that looks like neither a
creature nor an object is now filed as something that happened.

The refusal fact was written against the joined room and read against
the observed place, so the one reader written for it never found it, and
worse, it would have orphaned every time identity was recomputed. Then
the claim that walking the way later replaced the refusal turned out to
be a sentence in a docstring: the successful walk wrote a different
predicate entirely, so a door found shut stayed shut in memory for good.
Chasing that produced the better idea. The store keeps a changed value as
a contradiction worth preserving, which is right for what was learned and
wrong for a door. Whether a way is open is how it stands now, so it
belongs with the other things that are true at the moment, where a newer
reading simply replaces an older one.

The third was the most dangerous, because it wrote confident nonsense. A
character that had just rested, or been knocked down, would fail to move
and have a permanent shut door recorded on a perfectly walkable exit. The
fix came from the contract we had already written for darkness: a way
that refuses costs nothing. Paying movement and arriving nowhere is
something else entirely, and when the cost cannot be established,
nothing is claimed at all.

The pattern across all three is one thing. Recording a fact and reading
it are two halves of the same feature, and I keep landing the first and
calling it done.

### 11. Four cheap conveniences that took the map apart

Each of these was defensible on its own. The game names the room behind
every exit, so ask on arrival. The room text never changes, so read it
once. The text repeats on every visit, so turn it off. The game will
loot a corpse itself, so let it.

Together they produced a run that ended with a level 1 character, no
gold, no kills, stuck resting, and a record claiming its auto-flee
threshold had been set.

The chain, in the order it happens. Turning the room text off means
every arrival records an empty description, overwriting the text an
earlier look had earned. Room identity is keyed partly on that text, so
the keys flip on every step and rooms with the same title merge and come
apart again. The map stops growing. The sweep walks the same four rooms
in a circle for twenty six moves. Three commands per step against a
thirty second limit on the call blows the limit, so the sweep is cut off
and the model is told only that its tool failed.
Its own rest reflex sits the character down underneath the model, which
spends its last five turns trying to walk a character it cannot see is
resting, because the block does not mention posture.

Meanwhile the auto-flee command was not a command. The game answered
"Huh!?!" and we wrote "applied" into the record. The advice the agent
was supposed to carry never reached it either: the file is not copied
into a measured run and the capability is off by default, and the code
treats a missing file as no advice rather than as a fault. So the run
intended to measure that feature measured its absence and said nothing.

None of it was visible in the tests. Each piece was tested alone against
inputs built by hand, and the pipeline that clobbers the data was never
in any test. It was visible immediately in one real run, to a reader
who went looking for what the code does rather than what it says.

What I take from it: cheap is not free, and four cheap things landed in
one afternoon interact in ways that no one of them predicts. The rule I
would give myself is that anything which changes what is recorded, not
just what is displayed, has to be run before the next such change lands.

### 12. A bound in steps, inside a call bounded in seconds

The sweep that circled for twenty six moves had a second problem
underneath the first, and it is the more interesting one. A routine
stops after sixty steps. The call carrying it is abandoned after thirty
seconds. Nobody had ever put those two numbers next to each other.

The run says what happens when you do. Of three sweeps, one finished and
reported. The other two issued 149 and 88 commands, left no stop record
at all, and returned nothing: 237 of the run's 281 commands, four fifths
of everything the character did, invisible to the model that asked for
it.

I first wrote that the abandoned sweeps kept walking unattended. That
was wrong, and the review that caught it made the defect clearer rather
than smaller. Both sweeps stop at the same instant, 29.85s after their
call, because the agent does send a cancellation and the server library
does honour it. Control is never lost. What is lost is the report, which
is the only thing the model ever sees.

Reaching the honest number took three attempts and I got it wrong each
time in the same way. I measured the gap between one journal event and
the next and called it the cost of a command. The gaps hold whatever was
waiting: a turn boundary carrying the model's own thinking time, a pause
while the character is reset, a rest sleeping through six seconds. My
first margin was built on a 1.995s "slowest command" that was setup work,
a `score` arriving two seconds after a reset pause had ended, before any
routine existed. Restricted to commands inside a routine, the slowest gap
is 0.303s, and measured properly at the wire, send to reply, the slowest
command in the entire run is 0.114s. The margin I had derived was twice
what the evidence supported, which is four seconds of every call, six or
seven steps of walkable ground thrown away.

So the margin is now two numbers that are named separately: a measured
worst step of 1.21s, four commands because a step stands the character
first, and an authored factor of about three that the run cannot justify
and the document says so. Insurance is allowed. Insurance dressed as
measurement is not.

The other thing the run settled is that a routine cannot rest. The rest
loop sleeps up to 120 seconds against a 30 second call, and the one rest
in the record recovered nothing at all: movement was 14 before it and 14
after 12.6 seconds of sitting, because regeneration lands on the game's
tick and not on ours. Worse, the cut arrived between the command that
sits the character down and the one that stands it up, so the character
stayed seated, the next order was refused, and the run ended that way.
There is no honest repair for that from inside a cancelled call, since
every wait fails at once. The repair is to never sit down: a routine
that finds movement low now stops and says so, and the model rests
between calls with the command it already had.

One more thing surfaced only because a reviewer asked what a missed case
would do. Making the deadline a new stop reason is safe only if every
place that reads an outcome stops on reasons it does not recognise. The
sweep did the opposite, listing what stops and letting the rest fall
through, and a step refused on the deadline returns without waiting for
anything, so a loop that carried on would spin without ever yielding.
Nothing would run, the connection would never be read, and the
cancellation that ends the call could not even be delivered. A missed
entry would not be a wrong answer, it would be a gateway that has to be
killed.

I proved that on purpose. Reverting the dispatch to its old shape and
running the new tests did not fail them, it hung the suite, and the
timeout I had wrapped around the test could not fire either, for exactly
the same reason. The tests now cap the refusals and fail with a sentence
instead. Two of them, written first, had passed against the reverted
code because both reached the one dispatch site that was already
correct.

Evidence: [the plan](../plans/week3_capable/features.md), [the
design](../plans/week3_capable/routine_bounds.md), and
`week2_capable/gateway/tests/test_navigation_bounds.py`. Against the
live game, three sweeps now pair start to stop with none past the
ceiling, and with the deadline moved in deliberately close, all three
stop on it and report.

What I take from it: a bound is only a bound in the unit the caller
measures in. Steps are not seconds, and the two had never been compared
because they lived in different packages.

### 13. A target nobody set, paid for with the thing being measured

The Observatory froze for minutes whenever a session was open. The cause
was arithmetic: the page asked for the whole story every 2.0 seconds and
the story took 2.4 seconds to build. Work arriving faster than it
finishes never drains, and because every handler did its reading inline,
the one slow call held the loop and the whole application stopped
answering.

Two things fixed it, and only one of them is interesting. The page now
asks whether anything changed, which costs 5 milliseconds, and fetches
the story only when the answer moves. The response also stopped carrying
the conversation: every model request embeds the messages before it, so
1154 records held 16.9 MB, all of it shipped on every tick to draw
240-character excerpts. Withholding those five fields and serving them
per record on request took the body from 19.3 MB to 3.7 MB and the
sanitising from 601 ms to 14 ms.

The interesting part is what I did next. I wrote "under 300 ms" into the
plan, nobody having asked for it, and then built a record window to
reach it: the story returned the most recent 200 of 4845 records. It hit
the number. It also opened the session at Turn 2 with its first
iteration numbered 122, and every heading that counted iterations
counted the loaded ones, so a chapter reported 11 where the session had
143. I had those numbers suppressed rather than treating them as the
signal they were. Review then found the window's own rule failing on
real data: 1314 records carry no iteration scope and sort inside one, so
the cut landed mid-iteration at 362 of 1180 window sizes, displaying a
cost of $0.000000 against $0.000325 actual.

Ibnou opened the page, saw a story that began in the middle, and the
window came out. What makes it worth recording is that the replacement I
designed was also wrong, and measurement said so before it was built.
The idea was an outline of every turn and iteration, always whole, with
contents loading forwards. But every figure an outline carries is an
aggregate over the records it replaces, so building it means projecting
all 4845 first: 0.0008 s of the 0.370 s. With nothing cached, each
contents request pays the projection again. It multiplies server work to
save transfer, and transfer was never the problem.

The endpoint now returns every record: 3.57 MB in 0.535 s, fetched only
when the session has actually changed. The plan carries both rejections
with the numbers that killed them.

The lesson is not about caching or payloads. A performance target
invented by the person doing the work, and never shown to the person the
work is for, is indistinguishable from a requirement once it is written
down, and it will be paid for out of whatever is not being measured. The
hang was fixed by not asking, not by making the answer smaller.

### 14. The agent was told what it could see, and it stopped wandering

Until this run the agent was handed a goal and a set of tools and left to
work out its situation from whatever the last command printed. Watching
it, the behaviour was always the same: it walked. Of 143 decisions in one
earlier run, 109 were a move. It never fought anything, never bought
anything, never consulted what it had already learned.

The idea was to put a short description of the situation in front of it
before every decision: the room and how often it had been there, each way
out and whether that way had been walked, what was standing in the room,
its own health and money and whether it was hungry, how much of the world
it had mapped, and anything it had noted itself. Written fresh each time,
never accumulated, so it can never describe a moment that has passed.

The first run with it reads differently from every run before it. Moves
fell from three quarters of all actions to about a third. It sized up a
creature before fighting, attacked, and fled when the fight turned. It
bought, it ate, and it asked itself what it already knew. None of those
had happened once in any earlier run. The world it had mapped grew from
eight rooms to eighteen.

It also failed, in a way worth keeping. Every one of the thirty eight
descriptions ended with the same two lines: you are hungry, you are
thirsty, and nothing recovers while that lasts. True, and useless. The
character had no money and nothing to eat, so there was no action that
would clear either line. The agent spent the run trying anyway, and its
last three thoughts are almost word for word the same sentence about
being stuck. It never looked for the guild it had been sent to find.

Advice that cannot be acted on is not advice, and repeating it thirty
eight times does not make it truer. What the description needs is a sense
of what the agent can actually do about what it is being told.

The second failure was in the bill. The run cost twenty nine times more
per decision than the one before it, and ended by hitting its money
ceiling after thirty seven decisions rather than running out of steps.
The cause is that the model provider charges much less for a request
whose opening is identical to the last one, and the description, being
different every time, was placed at the very end where the reuse marker
sits. Every request therefore looked new. The fix is to move the marker
to the last part that does not change, and the lesson is that where you
put something in a request is a cost decision as much as an attention
one.

### 15. The world the agent can walk is a seventh of the world

Every run starts in the temple at the centre of the main city. Walking
outward from it through the exits the world actually has reaches 1,865
rooms in 33 areas. The world has 12,700 rooms in 189 areas. The rest is
reached by ship, by portal, by being carried, or not at all. This matters
because we had been judging how much of the world the agent had explored
against the larger number, which was quietly telling us it had seen
almost nothing when the part it can walk to is about a seventh of what we
were counting.

Fresh evidence that observation 9 is still live: in one session the agent
knew six rooms, and one of them we could not match to any room in the
game's own files. Knowledge we cannot tie to a place in the world is
knowledge the agent cannot route with, cannot return to, and cannot carry
into the next run.

### 16. The knowledge we added made the agent worse at an easy errand

We turned the five capabilities into an experiment: six arms on one mission,
three attempts each, every attempt playing a character the game had never
seen so that nothing could carry over between them. The mission was to find
the bakery and read its menu, judged from the game's own output.

The agent with nothing switched on solved it in 16.7 model calls. The agent
carrying the situation summary we built for it took 38.5, cost four and a
half times as much, and was the only arm that failed an attempt at all,
running to its money ceiling after 103 calls. Adding route planning on top
made it worse again, at 51.3.

The summary was built for the opposite problem. The runs it was designed
against burned 86 calls per attempt wandering, and it cut that by telling the
agent where it was and what it had already seen. On a short errand inside the
city there is nothing to lose track of, so the same text is a bill with
nothing to pay for it. Survival came out best on paper at 15.3 calls, but the
per-attempt spread overlapped the control completely and nothing died in any
arm, so the reflex it exists for never fired. At three attempts that is an
observation and not a result.

The lesson is about the shape of the evidence rather than the numbers. A
capability is not good or bad on its own, it is good or bad for a problem,
and we had been measuring ones built for a long hunt against an errand with
none of the hunt's difficulty. The honest conclusion is not that the
knowledge work is wrong. It is that this mission cannot rank it, and that
anything which helps a lost agent looks like pure overhead to one that is not
lost. The measurements are in
[the capability matrix report](../reports/week3_capability_matrix.md).

## Technical Conclusions

- Repeated identical attempts did fail in a stable pattern, and that
  pattern ranked the build order better than argument: confirmed.
- Most of the budget was lost to navigation, not decisions: confirmed,
  and moving navigation into deterministic routines removed two thirds
  of all model calls.
- Survival mechanics fired inside short runs without the agent
  understanding them: confirmed at baseline, and the reflex layer plus
  bounded routines reduced observed hazard events to zero in the
  measured cohorts, with the safer-ground caveat retained.
- Knowledge retained across runs makes repeat missions cheaper:
  partially confirmed. Coverage compounds strongly, but the mission's
  cost ceiling, not knowledge, currently bounds each run, so the curve
  shows in mapped ground rather than dollars.
- Moving decisions into deterministic machinery risks hiding failures
  instead of fixing them: confirmed the hard way. Aggregate numbers
  looked like progress while the transcripts showed a blind explorer
  driven by a broken instruction. Machinery without transcript-level
  verification, and without a success metric tied to the actual game
  goal, optimizes the wrong thing efficiently.
- Room identity is a prerequisite nobody planned for. Knowledge that
  cannot be joined across runs is not memory, and the compounding-map
  result was an artifact of counting identities instead of rooms.
- Open: the knowledge contract needs a revision before more capability
  work: completeness (qualitative observations must become facts),
  access (the model must be able to read what it knows), and feedback
  (exploration must return experience, not geometry). The game strategy
  layer that week 0 held in prose has no carrier yet.

## Key Takeaway

Machinery made the agent cheap and safe before anyone checked whether it
understood the game; the transcripts showed it did not, and only reading
them revealed it.
