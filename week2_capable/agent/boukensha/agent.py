"""Agent: the turn loop.

One ``run`` drives a turn: call the model, normalize the reply, dispatch every
tool the model asked for back through the registry, feed the results into the
conversation, and repeat until the model ends the turn or the iteration ceiling
is reached. The ceiling is a trigger threshold, not a hard cap: reaching it
makes one tools-disabled wind-down call rather than raising.
