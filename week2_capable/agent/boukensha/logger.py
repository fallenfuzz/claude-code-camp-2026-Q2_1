"""Logger: a structured recorder for one session's turns.

One :class:`Logger` writes one JSON Lines file, one complete JSON object per
line, each tagged with ``session_id``, ``at``, and ``phase``. This is a file
logger for machine reading and ``tail``/``grep``, not user-facing display. The
agent's loop drives it: a line per iteration, prompt, model response, tool call,
tool result, and the turn's terminal event.

The response event carries execution metadata (task, provider, model, normalized
token counts, and an estimated USD cost when the model has per-token pricing), so
a session log states exactly which model answered and what it cost.
