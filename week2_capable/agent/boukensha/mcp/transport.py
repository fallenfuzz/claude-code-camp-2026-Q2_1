"""Transport: move JSON-RPC messages to and from a live MCP server.

The transport owns the connection and the process, and correlates responses to
requests. The :class:`~boukensha.mcp.client.Client` above it owns the protocol
(building ``initialize``/``tools/list``/``tools/call`` envelopes and reading
their results). Splitting the two mirrors the HTTP client's injectable-transport
convention (``boukensha.client``): a test can drive a :class:`Client` over a fake
transport, and a non-stdio transport could slot in later without touching the
client.

:class:`StdioTransport` spawns the server as a subprocess and reads its stdout on
a single background thread, routing each response to the caller waiting on its
request id. That thread is what buys two things a blocking ``readline`` loop
cannot:

- a per-call timeout, so one hung tool call cannot hang the whole agent turn, and
- prompt, exit-code-aware failure when the server crashes or closes the pipe,
  waking every blocked caller at once instead of one dead read at a time.
