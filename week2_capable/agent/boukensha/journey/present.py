"""Present: turn raw logger events into readable journey beats.

The TUI shows a human journey, not a debug log, so the noisy end-to-end trace
(prompt sizes, iteration counters, token counts, raw tool names with JSON args)
must never reach it. That separation is enforced HERE, at one boundary: the
presenter consumes the same logger events the TUI subscribes to and emits only
three kinds of card, the beats a reader cares about.

- ``RoomCard``   the MUD's room narration: title, description, exits.
- ``ActionCard`` what the agent did, humanized: ``move west``, ``look``,
  ``attack the fido`` (the ``tbamud__`` prefix and JSON args are stripped).
- ``ThinkingCard`` the agent's reasoning or objective, kept apart from MUD prose.

Plumbing events (``prompt``, ``iteration``, ``response``, token usage) produce
NO card, so the raw trace cannot leak into the TUI by construction. The full
trace still lives in the JSONL log and the log viewer, which own the
technical flow.

Framework-free by design (no Textual import): the presenter is unit-tested with
plain event dicts, and the generic renderer in :mod:`boukensha.tui` consumes the
cards it returns without knowing anything about a MUD.
