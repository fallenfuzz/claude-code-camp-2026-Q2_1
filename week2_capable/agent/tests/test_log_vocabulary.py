"""Every phase the logger can emit, asserted against the FILE.

The file is the interface every reader consumes, so a field asserted only through
`RecordingLogger` is untested from a reader's point of view: that fake captures what
the agent PASSED and never runs the real `Logger`. It is how three field losses stayed
green in one session, the agent having computed them and nobody having checked they
arrived.

So this drives the real writer for every phase in its own vocabulary and reads the
records straight back off disk. A field the writer drops fails here rather than in a
session somebody notices weeks later.

The reader's half of the same contract lives with the log viewer, which is a separate
program and tests against a checked-in fixture rather than importing this package. The
logger's refusal to raise while describing something has its own file,
`test_logger_robustness.py`.
