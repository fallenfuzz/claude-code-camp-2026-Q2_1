"""Advice on whether the character is fit for what it intends.

Nothing here acts. Each check reads facts the agent earned by playing and
says what it sees, naming the rule the observation belongs to, and the
agent decides. Advice that cannot be overruled is a leash, and a leash
would decide the mission on the harness's judgement rather than the
model's.

An override is legitimate and expected. What it is not is silent: the
advice and the choice both end up in the record, so a transcript shows
what was suggested, what was done, and why they differed.
