"""A logged-in session: the login sequence, one command at a time, everything journalled.

Sits above the transport and below the parser. It owns the login handshake and the reply
window, and it writes every byte and every command into the journal so that anything derived
later can be traced back.

THE LOGIN SEQUENCE HAS FOUR STEPS, NOT TWO. Name, then password, then a MOTD that waits on a
keypress, then a MENU where ``1`` enters the game. Sending newlines at the menu loops until the
bound runs out. The recorded corpus contains three tool results whose last line is that menu,
which is the same trap reached by accident, so the sequence is written out explicitly rather
than treated as a detail.

THE REPLY WINDOW IS DRAINED BEFORE EACH COMMAND. Unsolicited output ends in a prompt like any
other reply, so anything left in the buffer satisfies the next read and every reply after it
arrives shifted by one. Draining is not discarding: what arrives unbidden is journalled as its
own event, because the world acting on its own is a fact and not noise.
