"""Bytes to and from the game, captured exactly, with negotiation filtered out.

The lowest layer. It knows about sockets, telnet control codes, and where one reply ends. It
knows nothing about rooms, commands or consumers, so it can be tested against a fake server
with no game running and replayed against recorded traffic with no server at all.

INCREMENTAL FRAMING IS THE POINT OF THIS MODULE. A socket hands over arbitrary chunks, so a
three-byte IAC sequence or the vitals prompt can be split across two reads. A filter that
processes each chunk independently loses the tail of whatever straddles the boundary, and the
loss is invisible: the text still looks like text. So parsing runs over a persistent buffer and
an incomplete sequence at the end of a chunk is held, not dropped.

WHAT GETS CAPTURED, AND WHAT DOES NOT. Every byte in both directions is recorded with a
monotonic and a wall timestamp, because a claim about a run that cannot be traced to the bytes
that caused it is an assertion. The one exception is credentials: the password line is recorded
as its length, never its content, since a wire log is read by people and shipped to a viewer.
