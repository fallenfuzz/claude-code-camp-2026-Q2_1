"""Audited single-line fallback for explicitly enabled profiles.

An arbitrary line bypasses typed command rendering, so it exists as a named
capability with stronger auditing and is denied by every named profile.

WHY A ROLE RATHER THAN A FLAG. A boolean is one wrong default away from being on. A role has to
be constructed with a value that does not exist on the agent's side of the process, so the
mortal path cannot enable it by getting a configuration wrong. `role` is not a permission check
against a caller's claim about itself, which is why the agent's own claim is never consulted.

WHY IT IS STILL REFUSED FOR SOME INPUT EVEN AS THE HARNESS. Newlines would let one call become
several commands, which turns a logged line into an unlogged batch and makes the journal a lie
about what was sent. That is refused for every role, because the reason has nothing to do with
trust.

Normal profiles deny this capability. The MCP server supplies the trusted role
only after its session-static profile authorizes the call. The caller cannot
claim a role in tool arguments.
