"""Typed mission readiness for the campaign capability.

One JSON snapshot answering the campaign controller's questions from
facts the agent already earned: has the target been sighted, how healthy
and mobile is the character, what level and gold does it hold, and how
much unexplored ground remains. Matching a sighting against the mission
target compares two pieces of owned data, the same rule that lets travel
match remembered titles.
