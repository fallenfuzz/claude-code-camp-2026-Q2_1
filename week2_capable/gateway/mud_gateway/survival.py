"""The survival capability's reflex engine.

Standing behaviors enforced by the harness on typed numbers, never on
prose: keep the game's own auto-flee threshold set, and rest before
movement depletes. Every reflex firing is journaled with its rule id and
the numbers that triggered it, so the Observatory explains each one like
any other decision.
