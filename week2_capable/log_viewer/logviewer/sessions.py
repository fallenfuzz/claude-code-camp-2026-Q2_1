"""Sessions: find the session logs on disk and say enough to pick one.

The question a person actually has is "which run was that", so a summary answers it
with when, what model, how long, what it cost, and how it ended. Everything comes
from the file: the writer is the logger, and this module only reads.

Kept apart from :mod:`logviewer.logview` because choosing a session and reading one
are different jobs. Listing must stay cheap enough to run over a directory of
hundreds of files, so a summary reads the records once and keeps no bodies.

The sessions directory is an ARGUMENT, never resolved by importing the agent's
config. That single import was the viewer's whole coupling to the program it reads,
and a reader meant to outlive its writer cannot depend on the writer to find its
own input. ``default_dir`` resolves the conventional location independently, by the
same documented rules, so the viewer reads a log written by any version.
