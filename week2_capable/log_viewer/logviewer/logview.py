"""Logview: read a session log into records, and derive what a reader asks of it.

The logger is the only writer and the JSONL file is the interface, so this is a
READER over a contract rather than a second implementation. It imports no agent, no
backend and no REPL, which is why a session written by any earlier step can be read
by this one.

Two rules shape everything here:

- Render what the writer recorded, derive nothing it already computed. Cost is
  calculated once at the call site where the model, the usage and the rates are all
  in hand, and logged as a fact. A reader that recomputed it would eventually
  disagree with the bill, which is worse than not showing it.
- Be tolerant at the edges. A live session is being appended to while it is read, so
  the final line is often half written. That is "in progress", not corruption, and
  an unknown phase from a newer step renders rather than raising.

This module holds no presentation. It produces records and figures that a terminal
renderer, a web page, or a test can each consume, so the medium is a separate
decision from the reading.
