"""The completeness rule, enforced against a fixture rather than against the writer.

EVERY FIELD THE LOGGER WRITES HAS A PLACE IN THE VIEWER. Testing that by importing
the writer would undo the independence this package exists to have, so the contract is
pinned as a FIXTURE instead: `fixtures/every_phase.jsonl`, produced once by the real
logger with every phase and every field populated, and checked in.

That gives both properties at once. The fixture is a genuine record, not a
hand-authored approximation of one, and the viewer needs nothing but the file to prove
it reads all of it. When the writer gains a field, regenerating the fixture is the
deliberate act that brings it into scope, and until then this test states exactly what
the viewer is known to handle.

The WRITER publishes it, which keeps the dependency pointing the right way. From the
agent step that owns the vocabulary:
